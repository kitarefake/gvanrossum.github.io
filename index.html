I Am</a></H3>

<P>I am the author of the <A HREF="http://www.python.org" >Python</A>
programming language.  See also my <A HREF="Resume.html">resume</A>
and my <A HREF="Publications.html">publications list</A>, a <A
HREF="bio.html" >brief bio</A>, assorted <a
href="http://www.python.org/doc/essays/">writings</a>, <a
href="http://www.python.org/doc/essays/ppt/">presentations</a> and <a
href="interviews.html">interviews</a> (all about Python), some
<a href="pics.html">pictures of me</a>,
<a href="http://neopythonic.blogspot.com">my new blog</a>,
and my <a
href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/index.jsp?blogger=12088">old blog</a>
on Artima.com.

<P>This web page is not one of my priorities.  Much of the information
here is several years old, and although still correct, not necessarily
very relevant.  I do try to make sure that all the links work, from
time to time.

<p>In December 2005 I joined <a
href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> in Mountain View, CA.  I knew
Google's services to be awesome; to work there is even better.  But
best is that I get to spend half my time on Python, no strings
attached!

<p>In July 2003, I left Zope Corporation to go work for Dan Farmer's
new company, <a href="http://www.elementalsecurity.com">Elemental
Security</a> in San Mateo, California.  I have moved with my family to
the San Francisco bay area.  For better or for worse, the news made <a
href="http://slashdot.org/articles/03/07/09/1549236.shtml?tid=126&tid=156&tid=172">Slashdot</a>...

<p>In June 2003, I was finalist in the category "IT - Software
(Individual)" of the <a
href="http://www.wtn.net/new/awards/2003/winners/index.html">World
Technology Network awards</a>.

<p>In May 2003, I received the <a href="http://www.nluug.nl">NLUUG</a>
Award 2003 for extraordinary services to the community of users of
Unix and Open Systems.

<P>In February 2002, I was given the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/press/2002-02-16-FSF-Award.html">Free
Software Foundation Award</a>.

<p>On November 5, 2001, my son Orlijn was born.

<P>From October 2000 through July 2003, I work for <a
href="http://www.zope.com"
>Zope Corporation</a>, makers of <a href="http://www.zope.org"
>Zope</a>.  Read about the <a
href="http://www.python.org/digicool.html"
>transition</a>.

<p>From May through October 2000, I worked for BeOpen.com.
Unfortunately, this stint was not a success for me or for the
PythonLabs team (who moved with me to Zope Corporation).  Before
that, I worked from 1995 through 2000 for <a
href="http://www.cnri.reston.va.us" >CNRI</a> in Reston, Virginia, and
before that from 1982 through 1995 for <a
href="http://www.cwi.nl">CWI</a> in Amsterdam.

<P>In May 1999, I received the <A HREF=
"http://www.ddj.com/articles/1999/9906/9906a/9906a.htm" >Dr. Dobb's
Journal 1999 Excellence in Programming Award</A>, together with Donald
Becker.


<H3>How to Reach Me</H3>

<P>You can send email for me to guido (at) python.org.
I read everything sent there, but if you ask
me a question about using Python, it's likely that I won't have time
to answer it, and will instead refer you to
help (at) python.org or
<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=comp.lang.python"
>comp.lang.python</a>.  If you need to talk to me on the phone or
send me something by snail mail, send me an email and I'll gladly mail
you instructions on how to reach me.

<H3>My Name</H3>

<P>My name often poses difficulties for Americans.

<P><b>Pronunciation:</b> in Dutch, the "G" in Guido is a hard G,
pronounced roughly like the "ch" in Scottish "loch".  (Listen to the
<A HREF="guido.au">sound clip</A> below.)  However, if you're
American, you may also pronounce it as the Italian "Guido".  I'm not
too worried about the associations with mob assassins that some people
have :-)

<P><b>Spelling:</b> my last name is two words, and I'd like keep it
that way, the spelling on some of my credit cards notwithstanding.
Dutch spelling rules dictate that when used in combination with my
first name, "van" is not capitalized: "Guido van Rossum".  But when my
last name is used alone to refer to me, it is capitalized, for
example: "As usual, Van Rossum was right."

<P><b>Alphabetization:</b> in America, I show up in the alphabet under
"V".  But in Europe, I show up under "R".  And some of my friends put
me under "G" in their address book...

against the wall for most of the evening until I found this link.
Thanks, Efflandt!  (Also, for fetchmail, the options "keep flush" seem
to be required.  Hope this helps some other poor soul...)<p>
