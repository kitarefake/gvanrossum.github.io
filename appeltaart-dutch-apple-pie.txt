Footnotes:

- The original recipe had 300g self-raising flour, a European concept;
  I'm substituting 250-300g flour, 3 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp salt.

- Substitute cornstarch equally for custard powder when it is
  called for as an ingredient in recipes for cakes, desserts or
  sauces. For instance, if the recipe calls for 2 tbsp. of custard
  powder, use 2 tbsp. of cornstarch. Add vanilla extract to match the
  flavor of custard powder. You can also substitute 2 tbsp. of flour for
  1 tbsp. of custard powder as a thickening in sauces or puddings.
