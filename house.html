<br>Reston, VA 20191-4017

<p>We don't know our new phone numbers yet.  The sale will be settled
on Dec. 3, 1999; we'll probably move in a week later.

as I have one.  In the mean time, here's a <a
href="http://tours.bamboo.com/usa/va/FX3030868.htm" >virtual tour</a>
of the house and the view from the dock, prepared by the real estate
company.

<p>We're really excited about the house.  For me, this is the first
house I've ever bought.  Kim owns her home in Baltimore, which she'll
keep for a few years while she still works there.  But the decision to
buy this house was made together, and she's doing everything she can
to find work in Reston so she can spend more time here.  The house is
exactly one mile from my office, so I can leave the car at home!

<p>The house was built in 1977, in a contemporary style - it's a
townhouse with brick and wood walls.  It's in excellent condition,
although the kitchen needs modernization (it still has the original
cooking range and brown formica cabinets!).  There are four levels: a
finished basement large enough for Kim to teach aikido, a roomy main
level with kitchen, dining and living room (with hardwood floors, a
deck, and a fireplace!), and two upper levels: on the first level are
three bedrooms and two bathrooms, the second level has a "party room"
with a deck.  From there you can see lake Thoreau - at least in the
fall and winter seasons, when the trees don't block the view.  There
are plenty of trees in the neighborhood, and even if you can't see the
lake, it's only a minute out the back door to get to the docks.  I
believe you can even swim there!

<p>Of course, we're even more excited about our <a

away!
