<P>"We have used Python to develop a simple multicast protocol which
we use to automatically reload a lab of 200 NT based systems from an
image server. The entire lot is reloaded in 7 minutes, the network
remains 85% available, Python helped us write the server in an
afternoon!"

<P>"If Perl weren't around, I'd probably be using Python right now."

<P>"Everything I've seen so far reinforces my impression from first
reading <i>Programming Python</i> -- damn, I <b>like</b> this
language.  I don't think I'm going to be writing much Perl in the
future..."

<P>"Python is an important part of Red Hat's system tools. We're
excited to see Python support expanded into Java-based systems, which
will further extend the reach of the Python language."

<!-- From: stk@infoseek.com -->

<P>"Over the past 30 years, I've written code in every major programming
language. Python is my favorite programming language by a wide margin.
It's an elegant, well-designed language that can be learned in a few hours.
In addition, the code is easy to read and large systems are easy to maintain.
The same code runs all major platoforms without re-coding or re-compiling.
There is simply no faster way to develop applications. A skilled Python
programmer can, on average, crank out applications five times faster than 
a programmer in more traditional languages. Java and Perl have more "hype",
but
Python is much faster to learn, easier to code, easier to debug, and easier
to read.
The language is also easy to extend because the source code of the
underlying system is 
very clean and freely available.

<P>"Our award-winning Ultraseek Search engine is coded in Python. It's won
every competitive
review we know about. Today's version has many more features than any of 
our competitors. Yet the original version, which had features comparable to
our competitors,
was coded in only 3 months by one programmer who didn't know Python before
he started."
