Graphs are networks consisting of nodes connected by edges or arcs.  In
directed graphs, the connections between nodes have a direction, and are
called arcs; in undirected graphs, the connections have no direction and
are called edges.  We mainly discuss directed graphs.  Algorithms in graphs
include finding a path between two nodes, finding the shortest path between
two nodes, determining cycles in the graph (a cycle is a non-empty path
from a node to itself), finding a path that reaches all nodes (the famous
"traveling salesman problem"), and so on.  Sometimes the nodes or arcs of a
graph have weights or costs associated with them, and we are interested in
finding the cheapest path.<P>

There's considerable literature on graph algorithms, which are an important
part of discrete mathematics.  Graphs also have much practical use in
computer algorithms.  Obvious examples can be found in the management of
networks, but examples abound in many other areas.  For instance,
caller-callee relationships in a computer program can be seen as a graph
(where cycles indicate recursion, and unreachable nodes represent dead
code).<P>

Few programming languages provide direct support for graphs as a data type,
and Python is no exception.  However, graphs are easily built out of lists
and dictionaries.  For instance, here's a simple graph (I can't use
drawings in these columns, so I write down the graph's arcs):

<PRE>
    A -> B
    A -> C
    B -> C
    B -> D
    C -> D
    D -> C
    E -> F
    F -> C
</PRE>

This graph has six nodes (A-F) and eight arcs.  It can be represented by
the following Python data structure:

<PRE>
    graph = {'A': ['B', 'C'],
             'B': ['C', 'D'],
             'C': ['D'],
             'D': ['C'],
             'E': ['F'],
             'F': ['C']}
</PRE>

This is a dictionary whose keys are the nodes of the graph.  For each key,
the corresponding value is a list containing the nodes that are connected
by a direct arc from this node.  This is about as simple as it gets (even
simpler, the nodes could be represented by numbers instead of names, but
names are more convenient and can easily be made to carry more
information, such as city names).<P>

Let's write a simple function to determine a path between two nodes.  It
takes a graph and the start and end nodes as arguments.  It will return a
list of nodes (including the start and end nodes) comprising the path.
When no path can be found, it returns None.  The same node will not occur
more than once on the path returned (i.e.  it won't contain cycles).  The
algorithm uses an important technique called <i>backtracking</i>: it tries
each possibility in turn until it finds a solution.<P>

<PRE>
    def find_path(graph, start, end, path=[]):
        path = path + [start]
        if start == end:
            return path
        if not graph.has_key(start):
            return None
        for node in graph[start]:
            if node not in path:
                newpath = find_path(graph, node, end, path)
                if newpath: return newpath
        return None
</PRE>

A sample run (using the graph above):

<PRE>
    >>> find_path(graph, 'A', 'D')
    ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
    >>>
</PRE>

The second 'if' statement is necessary only in case there are nodes that are
listed as end points for arcs but that don't have outgoing arcs
themselves, and aren't listed in the graph at all.  Such nodes could also
be contained in the graph, with an empty list of outgoing arcs, but
sometimes it is more convenient not to require this.<P>

Note that while the user calls find_graph() with three arguments, it calls
itself with a fourth argument: the path that has already been traversed.
The default value for this argument is the empty list, '[]', meaning no
nodes have been traversed yet.  This argument is used to avoid cycles (the
first 'if' inside the 'for' loop).  The 'path' argument is not modified:
the assignment "path = path + [start]" creates a new list.  If we had
written "path.append(start)" instead, we would have modified the variable
'path' in the caller, with disastrous results.  (Using tuples, we could
have been sure this would not happen, at the cost of having to write
"path = path + (start,)" since "(start)" isn't a singleton tuple -- it is
just a parenthesized expression.)<P>

It is simple to change this function to return a list of all paths (without
cycles) instead of the first path it finds:

<PRE>
    def find_all_paths(graph, start, end, path=[]):
        path = path + [start]
        if start == end:
            return [path]
        if not graph.has_key(start):
            return []
        paths = []
        for node in graph[start]:
            if node not in path:
                newpaths = find_all_paths(graph, node, end, path)
                for newpath in newpaths:
                    paths.append(newpath)
        return paths
</PRE>

A sample run:

<PRE>
    >>> find_all_paths(graph, 'A', 'D')
    [['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'], ['A', 'B', 'D'], ['A', 'C', 'D']]
    >>>
</PRE>

Another variant finds the shortest path:

<PRE>
    def find_shortest_path(graph, start, end, path=[]):
        path = path + [start]
        if start == end:
            return path
        if not graph.has_key(start):
            return None
        shortest = None
        for node in graph[start]:
            if node not in path:
                newpath = find_shortest_path(graph, node, end, path)
                if newpath:
                    if not shortest or len(newpath) &lt; len(shortest):
                        shortest = newpath
        return shortest
</PRE>

Sample run:

<PRE>
    >>> find_shortest_path(graph, 'A', 'D')
    ['A', 'C', 'D']
    >>>
</PRE>

<strike>These functions are about as simple as they get.  Yet, they are nearly
optimal (for code written in Python).  In another Python Patterns
column, I will try to analyze their running speed and improve their
performance, at the cost of more code.</strike><P>

<B>UPDATE:</B> Eryk Kopczyński pointed out that these functions are
not optimal.  To the contrary, "this program runs in exponential time,
while find_shortest_path can be done in linear time using BFS [Breadth
First Search]. Furthermore a linear BFS is simpler:"

<PRE>
    # Code by Eryk Kopczyński
    def find_shortest_path(graph, start, end):
        dist = {start: [start]}
        q = deque(start)
        while len(q):
            at = q.popleft()
            for next in graph[at]:
                if next not in dist:
                    dist[next] = [dist[at], next]
                    q.append(next)
        return dist[end]
</PRE>

Note that this returns the path in a weird format, e.g.,
<code>[[['A'], 'B'], 'D']</code>. In particular,
<code>len(find_shortest_path(graph, 'A', 'D'))</code> will give
the incorrect answer (2, because the outer list is of length 2). This is
because append is done as <code>[dist[at], next]</code> instead of
<code>dist[at]+[next]</code>. The second method would use quadratic
time and memory, but still should be fine for relatively small graphs;
otherwise, it is easy to turn the list into the correct format.<P>

Another variation would be to add more data abstraction: create a class to
represent graphs, whose methods implement the various algorithms.  While
this appeals to the desire for structured programming, it doesn't make the
code any more efficient (to the contrary).  It does make it easier to add
various labels to the nodes or arcs and to add algorithms that take those
labels into account (e.g. to find the shortest route between two cities on
a map).  <STRIKE>This, too, will be the subject of another column.</STRIKE></P>
